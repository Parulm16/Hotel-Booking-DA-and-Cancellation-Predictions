This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Below are the key highlights of the project:

Overview:
The project involves analyzing hotel booking data to gain insights into customer demographics and behaviors throughout the year. Additionally, various machine learning models were implemented to predict booking cancellations with a high degree of accuracy.

Key Achievements:
In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive EDA on booking data to understand customer demographics, trends, and patterns across different time periods.

Model Implementation: Implemented several machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to predict hotel booking cancellations. Achieved an accuracy of 86% in predicting cancellations.

Data Analysis: Utilized Numpy and Pandas for frequency analysis and trend identification in closing prices of stocks.

Visualization: Created insightful visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to present analysis results effectively.

Timeline:
Dec. 2022 - Jan. 2023: Implemented machine learning models and conducted analysis on booking data to predict cancellations.
